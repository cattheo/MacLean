<title>MacLean: Sums</title>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Sums</h1>

<p>MacLean provides a family of <em>functors</em> which construct <em>sums</em>.
A sum of (x:5) and (y:7) is constructed by picking one and injecting it with 
one of the the encodings
<pre>
inj0: 5 -&gt; 12 
      z = x + 7
inj1: 7 -&gt; 12 
      z = y
</pre>

Decoding a sum requires determining which injector was used to construct it,
along with extracting the value injected. This is usually done with a <em>case</em>
construction:
<pre>
case z of
  0 : 11..7 =&gt; z - 7 : 5
  1 : 6..0 =&gt; z : 7
</pre>


The notation <code>5 + 7</code> is commonly used to represent the sum.
Note that the term denotes the two constructing injections, as well as the decoder.
The actual type targetted by the injections is just \(12\) which is also
the domain of the decoder.
