<title>MacLean: Operators</title>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Operators</h1>
For some data category, a subcategory is used to specify a record of named operators
from which particalar operator may be chosen. For example
<pre>
3 : 5 : Ring . neg
</pre>
selects the negation operator of the ring of 5 elements and composes it with
the constant 3 to produce the constant 2.

MacLean is a category theoretic languagte meaning composition, not application,
is the fundamental operation. A constant such as <code>5 : 7<code> is an arrow
<pre>
3: 1 -&gt; 7
</pre>
which picks out the value 3 from the set 7. The result of the computation
is therefore the arrow
<pre>
2: 1 -&gt; 7
</pre>

Note carefully the type 5 is not a ring.  There is only one data type
in MacLean, the subranges of integers. These types are the objects
of the data categories. All type information is abstract, that is,
it is conveyed by restricting a data category to a subcategory which
restricts the visible arrow set to combinations of operators it specifies.
